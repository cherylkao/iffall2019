  <h1>Recipe WireFrame Feedback</h1>
  <h2> Feedback from Amie</h2>
  <p>Add captions to photos</p>
  <p>Hyperlink to chef/youtube video</p>
  <p>Swith serves 4 to 4 servings for consistency</p>
  <p>Get rid of total time, seems unnecessary</p>
  <div></div>
  <h2> Feedback from Diana</h2>
  <p>A little more space between the steps</p>
  <h2> Feedback from Erin</h2>
  <p>Add back to top and maybe a starting description</p>
  <p>Have the first rounded section the same width/margins as the photos</p>
  <p>Get rid of the extra number 3</p>
  <p>Maybe add another color based on images </p>
  <h2>Addressing Feedback</h2>
  <p>I plan on implementing most of the feedback I recieved from my peers, as a lot of it is switching small aspects for consistency.
    They also said that once I add in photos and color it'll be easier to see what is working and what isn't, but that the current wireframe base is easily readable.</p>
