		<div> Ayurvedic approaches have been used in molluscum contagiosum, lymphatic filariasis, vitiligo and lichen planus. Phyllanthus emblica (amla, Indian gooseberry) has been used in ayurvedic medicine. Standardized extracts of amla have a long-lasting and broad-spectrum antioxidant activity. This may be suitable for use in Anti-aging cream, sunscreen and general purpose skin care products.
