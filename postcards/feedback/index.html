  <h1>Feedback for Helen Xiu</h1>
  <h2>Desktop 1</h2>
  <p>Very legible, love the open space with the sky and stars. One suggestion is to maybe move the text in a tiny bit as it looks a little bit close to the edge, although I think full screen it would probably be fine. </p>
  <h2>Desktop 2 and 3</h2>
  <p>These are also very legible, I would move the text a little bit up on the second one as the postcard is very image and text heavy on the lower half.</p>

  <h2>Overall Feedback</h2>
  <p>It would be nice to see variation in the typefaces. I like how the text placement is different on all of them too.
    I also think the overall layout of all three is very similar but the imagery being all very different helps.</p>
